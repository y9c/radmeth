// The wand function executes the beta-binomial regresson pipeline. Parameters
// design_encoding and count_table_encoding are streams with the design matrix
// and the count table respectively. The test_factor_name parameter is the name
// of the factor with respect to which the differential methylation should be
// tested. All of the output is sent to the out output stream.
